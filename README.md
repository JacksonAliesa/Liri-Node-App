# LiriBot

What is "LiriBot"?

LiriBot is an application that a user can use through a computer terminal, using different NPM packages(axios, dotenv, moment, and node-spotify-api) to access data from API's with the help of NodeJS(server-side javascript). The NPM packages must be installed on the terminal before the application can run properly. The packages will load onto the package.json page under dependencies. 



User Capabilites: 

This application runs based off of a user's input. The user's input consists of "node, the document file name, the action it wants the terminal to run, and the search term for that specific action. See an example below.



The insert of "node" is indicating that we are using nodeJS. The document file name is where the actual javascript code is written for the applcation. There are three different "actions" the user can choose from to show results from 3 API's including,Spotify, OMDB, & BandsInTown. The three different actions set for this application are spotify-this-song, movie-this,concert-this. These actions will trigger which API to read from. Depending on which action the user chooses will dictate what the search term will be.
